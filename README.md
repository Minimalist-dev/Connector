# Connector
Connection between jdbc and a database relate.

Allows you to connect to other databases and users with different privileges. As with this way of instantiating it, it allows you to close the connection and free resources, avoiding overloads, blocking, server request errors and connection drops.

See the documentation at: (https://github.com/Minimalist-dev/Connector/blob/master/javadoc/index.html).
